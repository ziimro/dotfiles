# Zimmy's Arch Dotfiles
**This is a personal repo of my dotfiles so do not expect it to work perfectly on your pc**. If you encounter anny issues, i will not be responsible for any damage


This Repo contains configs to:
- Polybar
- BSPWM & SXHKD
- AwesomeWM (for now its just forked from ArcoLinux config files)
- Qtile (also forked from ArcoLinux config files)
- i3 (i forgot what was in there)
- Picom
- .xinitrc
- .bashrc
## Installation
I have not made an instalation script yet, but i highly reccomend you link the files to your desired directory using
```sh
ln -sf /dir1 /dir2
```
_most programs read config files from .config_
